# Capturing UDP packets

# Using tcpdump

1) Using the command tcpdump - 
> tcpdump
This will print all the packets trace on the console

2) We can also use to send the packets into a file
> tcpdump -w filename.ext
> tcpdump -w output.pcap 

3) Counting packets with -c
> tcpdump -w output.pcap -c 10
# This will capture only 10 packets

4) Printing the UDP .pcap files with -r
> tcpdump -r output.pcap

5) Looking at real UDP packet headers
> tcpdump udp -X -c 1
# -X prints out the packet in both hex and ASCII
